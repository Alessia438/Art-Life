					<h2>The style</h2>
						<p>
							The Bodoni style is one of the most known styles between the XVIII and XIX centuries. The XVIII century is characterised by the presence of the philosophical ideas of the Enlightenment and from the Neoclassic artistic movement.
							Bodoni, in the light of the period in which he lived, created his style on the basis of some of the most important Enlightenment concepts, including the search for an originary pureness and the belief in the human reason.
							This influence is clear for example in the fact that this style is simple and rigorous, just like reason requires clearness and rigour. 
							For example in the text there are only a few images, symbols or ornaments, since the reader focus has to be on the text, the core of a book.
							But at the same time the ideas of Neoclassicism are visible in the style and in the shape of Bodoni's works. Indeed the specifc aspects are characterised by classic influences. There is attention for the beauty and the readability of words.
							Serifs enlight the beauty of words and require wide spaces in order to be well readable. The search for a classical beauty is never oppressed by the rigour but at the same time beauty never prevents a good readability.
						</p>
					
					<h2>Font and measures</h2>
						<h3>General assumptions</h3>
							<p>
								Bodoni characters present “thin, horizontal serifs, vertical axes, high contrast between thick and thin strokes and round terminations on certain lowercase letters are the main features of these faces.“
								The presence of serif forces, in order to have a good readability, to set the letters large enough to ensure that the hairlines maintain their integrity.
								Text character spacing should also be kept open and even. Normal or even a little extra line spacing will also help to offset the strong vertical emphasis of Bodoni. 
								For best results, column width should be kept moderate. Very long lines of Bodoni tend to tire the eye and make reading difficult
							</p>
						<h3>Font</h3>
							<p>
								The fonts used in this magazine are 'Bodony 6 ITC' and 'Bodoni 72 ITC'. These are not original Bodoni's. 
								During the following centuries there have been a lot of remaking of the Bodoni font, each of them based on a different font (with regard to the Bodoni's 'Manuale tipografico').
								Each of them was produced for a peculiar need and by a specific team with different purposes and with a different distancing from the original font.
								The Bodoni ITC fonts were produced in the 90s and 'applied differences in design and proportions to the typeface in digital'. They were produced by two different teams:
								'ITC Bodoni Six, curated [...] by Goldsmith, was based on Filosofia Bassano by Bodoni'. It was designed 'after a comparative analysis of examples found in the Manuale tipografico' for small bodies.
								ITC Bodoni Seventytwo, curated by Fishman, was modelled on Papale, the larger dimension Bodonian typeface. Indeed it was designed for large body text.
							</p>
						<h3>Layout</h3>
							<p>
								Both in the cover page and in the articles the text is represented in one single column. The margins follow the measures of the gold ratio (see below), typical of the printing books in particular in the XVIII century one.
							</p>
							<p>
								The background for the cover is given by the overlap of an old fashioned paper on a special coloured paper derived from a Bodoni's book. The articles have instead the simple old fashioned paper.
								Both the cover page and the opening of the articles are presented as the introductive page of a Bodoni's book in the sequence: title, subtitle, author, image and date. They almost are in Bodoni 72.
								The body of the articles (sizes and spaces) are based onthe body of some Bodoni's prose books. The exceptions are the publication note, which is in the style of Bodoni's dedication poetry to marquise <a href="http://bibliotecabodoni.net/it/libro/aminta-1">Anna Malaspina</a>, 
								and the images descriptions, which are in the same style and size of the publication date. In both these last cases the choices are arbitrary since I could find no similar example.
								The images have been modified so that the colour recalss the mixture of black and white and sepia of the Bodoni's images. The picture sizes are based, in the first one in the 'preface' as the Tasso's image in <a href="http://bibliotecabodoni.net/it/libro/aminta-1">'Aminta'</a>, 
								all the others as the picture of Bodoni in the <a href="http://bibliotecabodoni.net/it/libro/manuale-tipografico-1">'Manuale tipografico'</a>.
								The text has the colour of the black ink, still used in the ancient printing machines.

							</p>
						<h3>Measures</h3>
							<p>
								Some of the Bodoni's books, digitized in <a href="http://bibliotecabodoni.net/it/biblioteca">Biblioteca Bodoni</a>, have been used as examples to produce this style.
							</p>	
							<ul>	
								<li><a href="http://bibliotecabodoni.net/it/libro/aminta-1">'Aminta'</a> was used as basis for:
							
									<ul>Cover and articles font proportions:
										<li> .author = 2/3 H1</li>
										<li> .byline = 17/5 H1</li>
										<li> .pubnote</li>
									</ul>
									<ul>Margins: 
										<li>since in a web page we are dealing with a single page, it is imagined as the left page of a book (left 2/3 right and top 2/3 bottom).</p>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li><a href="http://bibliotecabodoni.net/it/libro/the-castle-of-otranto">'Castle of Otranto'</a> was used as basis for:</p>
									<ul> proportion char space and word space</ul>
								</li>
							</ul>

				<h2>The style</h2>
						<p>
							The Liberty style, most widely known as Art Nouveau or Floreal style, comes out in the last decades of the XIX century and drives a part of the art and of the print untill the first decades of the XX century.
							The style, keeping up with the historical period, characterised by the development of industrial processes, aims to obtain a manieristic realism.
							The most relevant features of this art are the decorative elegance, the linearism and the use of asymmetry and of abundant floreal decorations. The pages are rich of pictures and floreal reproductions either stylized or curated and coloured.
							The liberty has been defined by the critiques 'the style without style'. This is due to the fact that the reproduction of the lines, figures and natural elements is of free interpretation and lacking in stylistic rigour.
							Moreover the typographer was allowed to great freedom int he composition of the page, in particular it was guided by the presence of flowers and other ornamental elements which, in some pages, have a great relevance with respect to the general layout.
						</p>
					
				<h2>Font and measures</h2>
					<h3>General assumptions</h3>
						<p>
							Stylization is one of the main characteristics of the Liberty style, both for the word style and for the page layout.
							The floreal decorations have a main role in the distribution of the spaces between the page elements. They can either surround the text or be located between the columns of the text.
						</p>
					<h3>Font</h3>
						<p>
							During the Liberty period, were produced many fonts, some of the are still used because of their beauty. Still none of them could prevail on the oder and becaome th emost representative of the entire movement.
							In the style of this magazine 2 families of fonts have been selected: Auriol and P22 Vienna Regular. The first one is known as one of the most representative fonts and his author, George Auriol the "quintessential Art Nouveau designer".
							The font has been used because of it's clarity and representativeness of the historical and typographic period. Inside this font family the choice fell on Auriol Normal for the text of the body and Auriol normal for subtitle and image descriptions.
							On the other hand, the P22 Vienna regular has been selected because it is the style of one of the most representative magazines of the Liberty style: Ver Sacrum. It has been used as the font for the titles since its shape is suitable for bigger font sizes.
						</p>
					<h3>Layout</h3>
						<p>
							The layout of the cover is based on some characteristics derived from different magazines of the liberty period. The most relevant of them are the Ver Sacrum and the Jugend.
							The layout is characterised by the central position of the text, included between an external, floreal figure surrounding it. The colors of the text and of the background are inspired from a litography produced by G. Auriol.
							Also the proportions, between the different components of the text and of the page, are derived from that litography. 
							The page changes for the small devices: the floreal frame and is replaced by a small, liberty like, flower. In this way the text can be more expanded on the page and be more readable.
							Also the background color changes in light yellow and the writings color changes into black, with a soft white contour, in order to have a better visibility in this new layout. In this case it is more similar to one of the editions of the Ver Sacrum.
							
						</p>
						<p>
							The articles type faces are based on a column division. The inspiration dates back to the newspaper Jugend, which bases its layout on three columns. For the purposes of readability the columns are reduced to two and one for medium and small screens respectively.
							The margins are pretty small, just like the Jugend ones.
						</p>
						<p>
							All the images are transformed with a strong black and white filter in order to resemble black and white drawings, typical insertions of Liberty journals. 
							The first image is different from all the others: it is bigger and fills the space of all the columns. This particular is inspired from many pages of the Jungend newspaper.
							All the others are smaller, they fullfill the 100% of the column space like simple images of the Liberty journals, which still don't use to insert a lot of images.
						</p>
						<p>
							In the articles the author is shifted at the end of the article. This is due to the fact that the author is usually located at the end of the article. 
							An arbitrary choice is related to the fact that is there is a publication note, it is placed after the author since, in our opinion, it is the solution closest tot he examples taken into account even if this precise occurence is never reported.

				<h2>The style</h2>
						<p>The Bauhaus was a school art founded in 1919 by Walter Gropius that would remain in operation for only 14 years, closing under the pressure from the Germany's Nazi regime. However the school’s ideology and founding principles lived on in the Bauhaus movement, which had a monumental impact on art across a spectrum of disciplines, from architecture to graphic design to typography. It established the modern age style principles in the Europe of the 1920s. A new Typography was born, one that abandoned the pravailing classical layout conventions, it was a simultaneous experience of vision and communication, all typefaces, type sizes and geometric forms were used to guide the viewer's eye. Its motto was "Form follows function", the priority was an unequivocal clarity in all typographical compositions, so it was imprinted on minimalism. The study of the communicative potential of letterforms and typographic layout lead to many innovations such as the elimination of capital letters, the replacement of the archaic Gothic alphabet used in German printing by a modern "cosmopolitan" font, and the concept of composition based on strong geometrical elements and expressive values of colors. These changes testify the movement towards objects meeting functional requirements suitable for mass production, in order to meet the needs of society and to create a new lifestyle.   </p>

				<h2>Font and measures</h2>
						<h3>General assumptions</h3>
							<p>Clarity, minimalism and the use of geometric shapes and colors are the main characteristic of this style. It is characterized by diagonal words and by a lower case font without serifs. Also, there are no pointless decorations and simple lines prevail. </p>

						<h3>Font</h3>
							<p> QUALI FONT E PERCHE --> FONTI The workshop of Herbert Bayer, teacher of the Bauhaus school, output almost exclusively used sans-serif typefaces, and Bayer experimented with crisp and geometric typographic compositions and introduced innovations in constructivist and functional design. Text was often justified, filling columns with wider spaces between letters and words. Contrast between font sizes was used to establish visual hierarchy. Lines, bars, circles and squares were used to divide up space and guide the eye through the composition.
							In 1925, Walter Gropius commissioned Bayer to design a typeface for use in all official communications by the Bauhaus school. Bayer designed an “idealist font”, the <b>Universal Type</b>  that perfectly enbodied the Bahuaus principles, it was in fact san serif (serifs were considered unnecessary) and had only lowercase letters (capital letters were considered redundant, and if spoken word does not require two cases, so should the written one). However this typeface was never finished and used. So i decided to use <b>Ronda regular</b> for the body, choosing it from the list of Bauhaus typefaces of Linotype (??????), it is a san serif font that reminds of the <b>Universal Type</b> of Bayer.
							For the figcaption i used the <b>P22 Bayer Universal</b>, a 1997 digital font that approximates letters drawn by Herbert Bayer at the Bauhaus. for h1,h2 and h3 i instead used the font <b>Bauhaus 93</b> created during “The Hidden Treasures — Bauhaus Dessau,” a campaign led by typeface designer Erik Spiekermann to turn fragments and sketches from the Bauhaus archives into functional fonts for Adobe Typekit.</p>

						<h3>Layout</h3>
							<p>The ispiration for the cover was taken from a of the poster of the Bauhaus
							Even though "Form follows function", the functionality needn’t be boring, so i choosed a modern Bauhaus inspired image for the articles' header, created by <a href="https://danilocampos.com.br">Danilo Campos</a> as a tribute to Bauhaus 100 years anniversary (https://www.bauhaus100anos.com.br/en/poster/3).</p>

						<h3>Measures</h3>
							<p>
								PROPORZIONI FONT, INTERLINEA, MARGINI, SPAZI TRA LE PAROLE
								Tschichold recommended a 2:3 page-size ratio that would be clear, intentional and definite, while the text area should be in accord with the Golden Section.
								While the margin proportions recommended are: 1:1:2:3.
								I followed Tschichold's ideas also for the position of the heading, not centerd, but on the left to create asimmetry, and the proportion of the primary heading, that is 180%. 
								(margin at least 20mm but on web is not useful)
								KERNING, LINE SPACING, TITOLI, LINEE

						<p>PRESENTAZIONE DELLO STILE E CARATTERISTICHE PRINCIPALI DEL TESTO E PARATESTO, INFLUENZE, ELEMENTI PRINCIPALI, SCOPO/TEMA ESTETICO</p>

						<p>Starting from the end of the eighties, teen magazines typographical style has drawn to really specific features: from <b>experimental layouts</b> to <b>geometric figures</b> as ornamental elements, to <b>handwritten fonts</b> and really <b>bright colors</b>. Indeed, the evolution of the typographic style of magazines for teenagers is part of a broader stylistic change that has affected the entire world of magazines since the end of the 1980s, in which many designers and magazines had decided to <a href="https://www.printmag.com/post/typography-in-the-1990s">embrace formal experimentation as a mode of critical inquiry, contesting values of legibility and order</a>. As for teen magazines, they certainly differ from the more experimental and purely artistic trends of this period, but are affected by this change, which emerges above all in the <b>non-linear arrangement of the text and its components</b>; and in the <b>exaggerate use of several colors and different outstanding fonts</b>(FONTE). In contrast to the presentation of the text in a linear and formal way, the pages of teen magazines often present a layout organically composed of different text boxes with <b>unrelated colors and fonts</b>, and above all <b>rich in images</b>, which may be outlined or overlapping, or their subject is cut out. In this overlapping of elements, forms and media, a typographic style is defined with a precise editorial purpose: to capture the attention of a new generation of young readers.</p>

					<h3>Minimalism & Design</h3>
						<p> PRESENTAZIONE DELLO STILE E CARATTERISTICHE PRINCIPALI DEL TESTO E PARATESTO, INFLUENZE, ELEMENTI PRINCIPALI, SCOPO/TEMA ESTETICO</p>
						<p>In recent years, in the world of typography and layout, some aspects have become radicalized to the point of leading us to believe that they will most likely also be present in the mise en page that we will see in magazines starting from 2021. Although typographical styles have multiplied and there are numerous contaminations between different media in the last two decades, especially thanks to the advent of new media and the World Wide Web, some specific addresses can be outlined as regards the minimal typographic style and that of design. First, the <b>alternation of massive titles in serif fonts with a body of the text in small dimensions with sans serif or delicate serif fonts</b>. Secondly, the <b>images are often large in size</b>, but are accompanied by <b>modest captions</b>. Third, the <b>margins are often wide but the line spacing is narrow</b>. Finally, the new keywords for the typographic style of the last few years are: <b>elegance, sober colors and clarity</b>. This is not an orderly and geometrically defined layout as for the modernist typography of the fifties and sixties, because today a super minimal layout stands out accompanied by <b>organic and natural shapes</b> and a strong impulse towards <b>humanity</b>, with hand-drawn illustrations, icons and fonts , along with texture ad grain effect. A functional design that seeks unique characteristics, provided by the means of the new media, such as <b>micro-interactions & micro-animations</b>, which fit into what is defined as <b>neumorphism</b> or neomorphism, as the elevation of skeumorphism, where design elements are presented as they appear in real life, which may be mixed with <b>flex design</b>, with familiar and clean interfaces, using highlights and shadows to convey realism.</p>
						<p>However, this theme cannot be just a copy of the present, for which some aspects that are supposed to be used in the coming years are radicalized, such as <b>animations and tools that make reading faster, easier, fluent or interactive, engaging</b>.</p>
