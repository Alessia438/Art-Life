# Art-Life

## Summary
The purpose of this web site is to explore various types of typographic and layout style for text documents, as an end-of-course project for the [Information Modeling and Web technologies](https://www.unibo.it/it/didattica/insegnamenti/insegnamento/2019/424627), held by professor Fabio Vitali, within the Master Degree in [Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge](https://corsi.unibo.it/2cycle/DigitalHumanitiesKnowledge) of the University of Bologna.

Art&Life is a toy magazine created to develop a repeatable and parameterized Metadata Model for Modern Magazines. Indeed, Art&Life was born as a framework with two aims: deploying magazine issues online according to historically accurate themes; and enriching the reading experience by providing an automate way of retrieving metadata from each article.

It is then possible to browse Art&Life issues and read the respective articles shown in different styles, within the context of a network of references across articles of the same issue.

The documents (articles) contained in this web site have been selected for their length and complexity from existing magazines, webzines and journals. Their publication here is not intended to be an alternative or replace their original locations.
