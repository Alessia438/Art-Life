					<h2>The style</h2>
						<p>
							The Bodoni style is one of the most known styles between the XVIII and XIX centuries. The XVIII century is characterised by the presence of the philosophical ideas of the Enlightenment and from the Neoclassic artistic movement.
							Bodoni, in the light of the period in which he lived, created his style on the basis of some of the most important Enlightenment concepts, including the search for an originary pureness and the belief in the human reason.
							This influence is clear for example in the fact that this style is simple and rigorous, just like reason requires clearness and rigour. 
							For example in the text there are only a few images, symbols or ornaments, since the reader focus has to be on the text, the core of a book.
							But at the same time the ideas of Neoclassicism are visible in the style and in the shape of Bodoni's works. Indeed the specifc aspects are characterised by classic influences. There is attention for the beauty and the readability of words.
							Serifs enlight the beauty of words and require wide spaces in order to be well readable. The search for a classical beauty is never oppressed by the rigour but at the same time beauty never prevents a good readability.
						</p>
					
					<h2>Font and measures</h2>
						<h3>General assumptions</h3>
							<p>
								Bodoni characters present “thin, horizontal serifs, vertical axes, high contrast between thick and thin strokes and round terminations on certain lowercase letters are the main features of these faces.“
								The presence of serif forces, in order to have a good readability, to set the letters large enough to ensure that the hairlines maintain their integrity.
								Text character spacing should also be kept open and even. Normal or even a little extra line spacing will also help to offset the strong vertical emphasis of Bodoni. 
								For best results, column width should be kept moderate. Very long lines of Bodoni tend to tire the eye and make reading difficult
							</p>
						<h3>Font</h3>
							<p>
								The fonts used in this magazine are 'Bodony 6 ITC' and 'Bodoni 72 ITC'. These are not original Bodoni's. 
								During the following centuries there have been a lot of remaking of the Bodoni font, each of them based on a different font (with regard to the Bodoni's 'Manuale tipografico').
								Each of them was produced for a peculiar need and by a specific team with different purposes and with a different distancing from the original font.
								The Bodoni ITC fonts were produced in the 90s and 'applied differences in design and proportions to the typeface in digital'. They were produced by two different teams:
								'ITC Bodoni Six, curated [...] by Goldsmith, was based on Filosofia Bassano by Bodoni'. It was designed 'after a comparative analysis of examples found in the Manuale tipografico' for small bodies.
								ITC Bodoni Seventytwo, curated by Fishman, was modelled on Papale, the larger dimension Bodonian typeface. Indeed it was designed for large body text.
							</p>
						<h3>Typeface</h3>
							<p>
								Both in the cover page and in the articles the text is represented in one single column. The margins follow the measures of the gold ratio (see below), typical of the printing books in particular in the XVIII century one.
							</p>
							<br>
							<p>
								The background for the cover is given by the overlap of an old fashioned paper on a special coloured paper derived from a Bodoni's book. The articles have instead the simple old fashioned paper.
								Both the cover page and the opening of the articles are presented as the introductive page of a Bodoni's book in the sequence: title, subtitle, author, image and date. They almost are in Bodoni 72.
								The body of the articles (sizes and spaces) are based onthe body of some Bodoni's prose books. The exceptions are the publication note, which is in the style of Bodoni's poetry, 
								and the images descriptions, which are in the same style and size of the publication date. In both these last cases the choices are arbitrary since I could find no similar example.
								The images have been modified so that the colour recalss the mixture of black and white and sepia of the Bodoni's images. The picture sizes are based, in the first one in the 'preface' as the Tasso's image in <a href="http://bibliotecabodoni.net/it/libro/aminta-1">'Aminta'</a>, 
								all the others as the picture of Bodoni in the <a href="http://bibliotecabodoni.net/it/libro/manuale-tipografico-1">'Manuale tipografico'</a>.
								The text has the colour of the black ink, still used in the ancient printing machines.

							</p>
						<h3>Measures</h3>
							<p>
								Some of the Bodoni's books, digitized in <a href="http://bibliotecabodoni.net/it/biblioteca">Biblioteca Bodoni</a>, have been used as examples to produce this style.
								<a href="http://bibliotecabodoni.net/it/libro/aminta-1">'Aminta'</a> was used as basis for:
							</p>
									<ul>Cover and articles font proportions:
										<li> .byline .author = 2/3 H1</li>
										<li> .byline = 17/5 H1</li>
										<li> per pubnote le pagine in poesia dedicate alla marchesa Anna Malaspina</li>
									</ul>
									<ul>Margins: 
										<li>since in a web page we are dealing with a single page, it is imagined as the left page of a book (left 2/3 right and top 2/3 bottom).</p>
									</ul>
								<p><a href="http://bibliotecabodoni.net/it/libro/the-castle-of-otranto">'Castle of Otranto'</a> was used as basis for:</p>
									<p>- proportion char space and word space</p>
							</p>
